# LDK Server

**LDK Server** is a fully-functional Lightning node in daemon form, built on top of
[LDK Node](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/ldk-node), which itself provides a powerful abstraction over the
[Lightning Development Kit (LDK)](https://github.com/lightningdevkit/rust-lightning) and uses a built-in
[Bitcoin Development Kit (BDK)](https://bitcoindevkit.org/) wallet.

The primary goal of LDK Server is to provide an efficient, stable, and API-first solution for deploying and managing
a Lightning Network node. With its streamlined setup, LDK Server enables users to easily set up, configure, and run
a Lightning node while exposing a robust, language-agnostic API via [Protocol Buffers (Protobuf)](https://protobuf.dev/).

### Features

- **Out-of-the-Box Lightning Node**:
    - Deploy a Lightning Network node with minimal configuration, no coding required.

- **API-First Design**:
    - Exposes a well-defined API using Protobuf, allowing seamless integration with HTTP-clients or applications.

- **Powered by LDK**:
    - Built on top of LDK-Node, leveraging the modular, reliable, and high-performance architecture of LDK.

- **Effortless Integration**:
    - Ideal for embedding Lightning functionality into payment processors, self-hosted nodes, custodial wallets, or other Lightning-enabled
      applications.

### Project Status

🚧 **Work in Progress**:
- **APIs Under Development**: Expect breaking changes as the project evolves.
- **Potential Bugs and Inconsistencies**: While progress is being made toward stability, unexpected behavior may occur.
- **Improved Logging and Error Handling Coming Soon**: Current error handling is rudimentary (specially for CLI), and usability improvements are actively being worked on.
- **Pending Testing**: Not tested, hence don't use it for production!

We welcome your feedback and contributions to help shape the future of LDK Server!


### Configuration
Refer `./ldk-server/ldk-server-config.toml` to see available configuration options.

You can configure the node via a TOML file, environment variables, or CLI arguments. All options are optional — values provided via CLI override environment variables, which override the values in the TOML file.

### Building
```
git clone https://github.com/toneloc/ldk-server.git
cargo build
```

This fork pins `stable-channels` as a local path dependency in `ldk-server/Cargo.toml`. Clone `toneloc/stable-channels` to the location that path resolves to before running `cargo build`. From the repository root:
```
cd ldk-server
git clone https://github.com/toneloc/stable-channels.git ../../../2026/stable-channels
```
The `ldk-server/Cargo.toml` entry (`path = "../../../2026/stable-channels"`) is relative to the crate directory one level deeper; the clone command above is the equivalent from the repo root.

### Running
- Using a config file:
```
cargo run --bin ldk-server ./ldk-server/ldk-server-config.toml
```

- Using environment variables (all optional):
```
export LDK_SERVER_NODE_NETWORK=regtest
export LDK_SERVER_NODE_LISTENING_ADDRESS=localhost:3001
export LDK_SERVER_NODE_REST_SERVICE_ADDRESS=127.0.0.1:3002
export LDK_SERVER_NODE_ALIAS=LDK-Server
export LDK_SERVER_BITCOIND_RPC_ADDRESS=127.0.0.1:18443
export LDK_SERVER_BITCOIND_RPC_USER=your-rpc-user
export LDK_SERVER_BITCOIND_RPC_PASSWORD=your-rpc-password
export LDK_SERVER_STORAGE_DIR_PATH=/path/to/storage
cargo run --bin ldk-server
```

Interact with the node using CLI. When `--api-key` is omitted, the CLI reads the key from its default storage path (`~/.ldk-server/<network>/api_key`); if your daemon uses a non-default `storage.disk.dir_path`, either pass the key explicitly with `--api-key <hex>` or point the CLI at the same config with `-c /path/to/config.toml`:
```
ldk-server-cli -b localhost:3002 --tls-cert /path/to/tls_cert.pem onchain-receive # To generate onchain-receive address.
ldk-server-cli -b localhost:3002 --tls-cert /path/to/tls_cert.pem help # To print help/available commands.
```

### Shell Completions

The CLI supports generating shell completions for Bash, Zsh, Fish, Elvish, and PowerShell.

Add completions to your shell config:
```bash
# Bash (add to ~/.bashrc)
eval "$(ldk-server-cli completions bash)"

# Zsh (add to ~/.zshrc)
eval "$(ldk-server-cli completions zsh)"

# Fish (add to ~/.config/fish/config.fish)
ldk-server-cli completions fish | source
```
