## Prerequisites

**Important:** You must start ldk-server before launching the GUI.

The server generates the TLS certificate on first startup, which is required for the GUI to connect.

```bash
# 1. First, start the ldk-server
cargo run -p ldk-server -- --config /path/to/ldk-server-config.toml

# 2. Wait for the server to start and generate the TLS certificate
#    You should see output indicating the server is listening

# 3. Then start the GUI (in a separate terminal)
cargo run -p ldk-server-gui
```

## Building

```bash
cargo build -p ldk-server-gui --release
```

## Running

```bash
cargo run -p ldk-server-gui
```

Or run the release binary directly:

```bash
./target/release/ldk-server-gui
```

## Running in Browser (WASM)

The GUI can also run in a web browser using WebAssembly.

### Prerequisites

Install [Trunk](https://trunkrs.dev/), a WASM web application bundler:

```bash
cargo install trunk
```

### Building and Running

From the `ldk-server-gui` directory:

```bash
cd ldk-server-gui

# Development server with hot reload
trunk serve

# Or build for production
trunk build --release
```

The development server runs at `http://127.0.0.1:8080` by default.

### Browser Limitations

When running in the browser:
- **TLS certificates** are handled by the browser, so the TLS Cert Path field is not needed
- **File dialogs** are not available. Use the **Load Config** button to paste your `ldk-server-config.toml` contents directly
- **Auto-loading** of config files is not supported; you must paste the config manually

### CORS Configuration

Your ldk-server must allow CORS requests from the browser origin. If you encounter CORS errors, ensure your server is configured to accept requests from `http://127.0.0.1:8080` (or wherever Trunk is serving).

## Configuration

### Auto-loading from Config File

The GUI automatically searches for `ldk-server-config.toml` in these locations:
- Current directory
- `../ldk-server/` directory
- Parent directory
- Path specified in `LDK_SERVER_CONFIG` environment variable

When found, the connection settings are auto-populated from the config file, including the auto-generated API key.

You can also click **Load Config** to manually browse for a config file.

### Manual Configuration

If no config file is found, configure the connection manually in the **Node Info** tab:

| Field | Description | Example |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| Server URL | The ldk-server REST API address (without `https://`) | `localhost:3002` |
| API Key | Hex-encoded API key (see below) | `4181fc9f...` |
| TLS Cert Path | Path to the server's TLS certificate | `/tmp/ldk-server/tls.crt` |

**Note on API Key:** The server auto-generates a random API key on first startup and stores it at `<storage_dir>/<network>/api_key`. To get the hex-encoded key manually:
```bash
xxd -p /tmp/ldk-server/regtest/api_key | tr -d '\n'
```

The TLS certificate is also auto-generated and located at `<storage_dir>/tls.crt`.

Click **Connect** to establish a connection.
