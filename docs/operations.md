# Operations Guide

This guide covers running LDK Server in production: process management, backups, security,
monitoring, and remote access.

## Process Management

### systemd

LDK Server integrates with systemd via `sd_notify`. It sends `READY=1` after the gRPC listener
is bound and `STOPPING=1` when shutting down. A sample unit file can be found in [
`contrib/ldk-server.service`](../contrib/ldk-server.service).

### Graceful Shutdown

The server handles `SIGTERM` and `CTRL-C` (SIGINT). On receipt, it:

1. Signals all active streaming clients (SubscribeEvents) to disconnect
2. Stops the LDK Node (persists channel state)
3. Exits cleanly

### Log Rotation

By default, LDK Server logs to `stdout`/`stderr` and also to file. When running under `systemd` or Docker, 
this allows the environment (e.g., `journald`) to handle persistence, rotation, and 
compression automatically.

If you enable `log_to_file` in the configuration, LDK Server writes logs to the configured file while still 
keeping the `stdout`/`stderr` logs available too. Logs files are automatically rotated at `max_size_mb` or `rotation_interval_hours`, and the last `max_files` uncompressed log files are retained. But you can disable 
the internal rotation and keep logging to file by setting the `max_size_mb` and `rotation_interval_hours` 
params to `0`.

If you prefer to use system `logrotate` for file logs, the server still reopens its log file on `SIGHUP`. Save 
the following config to `/etc/logrotate.d/ldk-server` (adjust the log path to match your setup):

```
/var/lib/ldk-server/regtest/ldk-server.log {
    daily
    rotate 14
    compress
    missingok
    notifempty
    postrotate
        systemctl kill --signal=HUP ldk-server.service
    endscript
}
```

## Backups

### What to Back Up

| File                                   | Priority     | Description                                                                |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `<storage_dir>/keys_mnemonic`          | **Critical** | BIP39 mnemonic. Required to recover on-chain funds. Default for new installs. |
| `<network_dir>/ldk_node_data.sqlite` or configured PostgreSQL database   | **Critical** | Channel state, on-chain wallet data, payment and forwarding history. Required to recover channel funds. |

### What is Reconstructable

- Network graph data (re-synced from gossip or RGS)
- Fee rate cache (re-fetched from the chain backend)
- Macaroon credentials (can be replaced, but clients will need new tokens)
- The TLS certificate (can be regenerated, but clients will need the new one)

> **Warning:** Do not restore a backup onto two running nodes simultaneously. Running the
> same node identity on two instances will cause channel state conflicts and potential fund
> loss.

## Security

### Macaroons

Keep `<network_dir>/macaroons/` private. It contains the default admin token in `admin.macaroon`
and the server's root keys in `roots/`. Give clients tokens, never root keys.

Use `create-macaroon` to give each client a token you can revoke separately. Use `derive-macaroon`
to make a restricted copy. Give each client only the permissions it needs.
See the [API guide](api-guide.md#authentication) for restrictions and request binding.

To replace an admin token, create and save a new admin token, then revoke the old ID.
Replace `admin.macaroon` with the new token or pass it with `--macaroon`.
The API prevents revocation of the last unrestricted admin token.

#### Recovery

Back up `roots/` and `admin.macaroon` together. Old root files can restore revoked access.
Deleting all roots invalidates every token; the server creates a new admin token on restart.

At startup, the server repairs a missing or invalid `admin.macaroon` from `roots/admin.toml`
and logs the change. It keeps valid tokens, even if restricted or expired. It warns if the
file holds a request token; replace that file with a reusable token.

If the original admin root is gone but other roots remain, the server warns instead of replacing
it. Use another admin token to create a replacement and save it as `admin.macaroon`.

Duplicate root names or IDs stop startup. Move conflicting files out of `roots/` and restart.
Files ending in `.tmp` are ignored.

Root-file caveat edits take effect after restart. `GetPermissions` shows them, and newly issued
tokens inherit them. Tokens issued earlier have separate roots and do not change.

The server logs successful token creation and revocation, including who made the change and
which token it affects. Logs contain no tokens or root secrets.

### TLS

- Self-signed ECDSA P-256 certificate generated automatically
- Private key stored at `<storage_dir>/tls.key` with `0400` permissions
- Certificate includes `localhost` and `127.0.0.1` in SANs by default
- Add your server's hostname/IP to `[tls] hosts` for remote access

### CA-Signed Certificates (Let's Encrypt / ACME)

For production deployments, many operators prefer a publicly trusted certificate. The
recommended approach is to provision the certificate outside of LDK Server (via an ACME
client) and point `[tls] cert_path` and `key_path` to the resulting files.

High-level flow:

1. Choose a public hostname for the gRPC endpoint (e.g., `ldk.example.com`).
2. Set `grpc_service_address` to bind on the public interface.
3. Add the hostname to `[tls] hosts` so SANs match what clients connect to.
4. Use an ACME client (certbot, lego, acme.sh) to obtain a certificate for the hostname.
5. Configure `[tls] cert_path` and `key_path` to the ACME output files.
6. Restart the server after renewals (LDK Server reads TLS files at startup).

Example (certbot with a pre-provisioned DNS or HTTP-01 flow):

```toml
[node]
grpc_service_address = "0.0.0.0:3536"

[tls]
cert_path = "/etc/letsencrypt/live/ldk.example.com/fullchain.pem"
key_path = "/etc/letsencrypt/live/ldk.example.com/privkey.pem"
hosts = ["ldk.example.com"]
```

Notes:

- Ensure the `ldk-server` process can read the cert and key files.
- After a renewal, restart the service to pick up the new certificate.
- If you want zero-downtime renewals, place a reverse proxy in front and terminate TLS there.

### Network Exposure

The gRPC service binds to `127.0.0.1:3536` by default. For remote access, either:

1. Change `grpc_service_address` to bind to `0.0.0.0:3536` and add the server's hostname to
   `[tls] hosts`, or
2. Use a reverse proxy (e.g., nginx, Caddy) that terminates TLS and forwards to the loopback
   address

## Monitoring

### Prometheus Metrics

LDK Server can expose metrics in [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) text format.
Prometheus is an open-source monitoring toolkit that scrapes HTTP endpoints and stores
time-series data for alerting and dashboards.

Enable metrics in the config:

```toml
[metrics]
enabled = true
poll_metrics_interval = 60
```

Metrics are served at `GET /metrics` on the same port as the gRPC service (default 3536).
This is a plain HTTP endpoint (not gRPC), returning Prometheus text format.

Basic Auth is recommended to prevent unauthorized access to node metrics:

```toml
[metrics]
enabled = true
username = "prometheus"
password = "secret"
```

The Prometheus scrape config would then use:

```yaml
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: ldk-server
    scheme: https
    tls_config:
      ca_file: /path/to/tls.crt
    basic_auth:
      username: prometheus
      password: secret
    static_configs:
      - targets: ["localhost:3536"]
```

### Available Metrics

Metrics cover:

- On-chain and Lightning balances
- Public and Private Channel counts
- Payment counts (successful, failed, pending)
- Peer count

## Remote Access

To allow clients to connect from other machines:

1. **Update TLS hosts:** Add the server's hostname or IP to `[tls] hosts` in the config so
   the certificate's SANs cover the address clients will use.
2. **Update bind address:** Set `grpc_service_address` to bind on the appropriate interface
   (e.g., `0.0.0.0:3536`).
3. **Distribute the TLS certificate:** Copy `<storage_dir>/tls.crt` to each client machine.
   Clients must pin this certificate since it is self-signed.
4. **Share the macaroon:** Provide the hex-encoded macaroon to authorized clients.

If you regenerate the TLS certificate (by deleting `tls.crt` and `tls.key` and restarting),
all clients will need the new certificate.

## Network-Specific Notes

Local data is stored in per-network subdirectories (`bitcoin/`, `testnet/`, `signet/`,
`regtest/`, etc.) under the storage root. This means you can run multiple networks from one
local storage directory without conflicts. PostgreSQL storage is not automatically isolated
by network; configure a distinct database or table for each network.

The `keys_mnemonic` file is shared across networks (stored at the storage root, not per-network).
Keys are split by network at the derivation path level, so the same mnemonic will produce
different keys.
